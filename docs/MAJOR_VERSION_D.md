  }
}
```

Then, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Migration Guide

### From Version C

If you're migrating from version C, most of your code should continue to work without changes. However, we recommend reviewing the following areas:

1. **Tool Usage Tracking**: The API has been streamlined for better usability
2. **Git Workflow Utilities**: New methods have been added for better GitHub integration
3. **Code Review System**: Consider integrating the new code review system into your workflow

### From Earlier Versions

If you're migrating from version B or earlier, please refer to the version C migration guide first, then follow the steps above.
