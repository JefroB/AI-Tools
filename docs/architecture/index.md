# AI-Tools Architecture Visualization

This documentation provides comprehensive visualizations of the AI-Tools architecture, component relationships, and data flows. These visualizations are designed to help developers understand the system structure and how different components interact.

## Color Scheme

The visualizations use a consistent color scheme to represent different types of components:

- **Deep Blue (#1E3A8A)**: Core modules and primary components
- **Teal (#0D9488)**: Performance-related modules
- **Purple (#8B5CF6)**: API and integration modules
- **Orange (#F97316)**: UI and visualization modules
- **Red (#EF4444)**: Security modules
- **Green (#10B981)**: Utility modules
- **Gray (#1F2937)**: Configuration and system modules

## Available Visualizations

- [Module Dependencies](./module-dependencies.md): Shows how different modules depend on each other
- [Feature Timeline](./feature-timeline.md): Visualizes when features were added over time
- [Data Flow](./data-flow.md): Illustrates how data moves through the system
- [Module Categories](./module-categories.md): Organizes modules by functional category
- [Optimization Pipeline](./optimization-pipeline.md): Details the prompt optimization process
- [Component Interactions](./component-interactions.md): Shows the sequence of interactions between components

## Interactive Features

These visualizations include several interactive features when viewed on GitHub Pages:

- **Hover for details**: Hover over components to see additional information
- **Click to navigate**: Click on components to navigate to related documentation
- **Zoom and pan**: For larger diagrams, you can zoom in/out and pan around
- **Filter view**: Filter the visualization to focus on specific components

## Automated Updates

These visualizations are automatically updated when the codebase changes, ensuring they always reflect the current state of the AI-Tools architecture. Each diagram includes a timestamp indicating when it was last updated.
