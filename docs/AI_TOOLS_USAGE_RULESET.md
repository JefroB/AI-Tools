## Tool Usage Principles

### Rule 1.1: Prioritize Existing Tools
- Always check for existing AI-Tools utilities before implementing custom solutions
- Use the toolkit's file operations instead of direct Node.js fs methods
- Leverage the toolkit's API utilities for all external API interactions

### Rule 1.2: Analyze Tool Usage Opportunities
- Before implementing any functionality, analyze if it could use AI-Tools utilities
- For common operations like file reading/writing, always use the toolkit's enhanced methods
- Consider how the toolkit's utilities can simplify error handling and edge cases

### Rule 1.3: Follow Established Patterns
- Maintain consistency with the toolkit's existing patterns and conventions
- Use the same error handling approaches as the toolkit
- Follow the toolkit's naming conventions and API design

### Rule 1.4: Leverage Advanced Features
- Use the toolkit's caching capabilities for expensive operations
- Implement memoization for repetitive function calls
- Utilize the metrics collection for performance monitoring

### Rule 1.5: Prefer Composition Over Custom Implementation
- Compose existing toolkit functions rather than creating new implementations
- Chain toolkit utilities to create more complex operations
- Use the toolkit's utility modules as building blocks

## Toolkit Extension Framework

### Rule 2.1: Identify Extension Opportunities
- Identify recurring patterns that aren't covered by existing utilities
- Look for opportunities to abstract common operations into reusable functions
- Consider how new utilities could benefit multiple projects

### Rule 2.2: Follow Extension Templates
- Use the established module structure for new utilities
- Implement consistent error handling and logging
- Include appropriate documentation and examples

### Rule 2.3: Maintain Backward Compatibility
- Ensure extensions don't break existing functionality
- Use optional parameters for new features
- Provide migration paths for significant changes

### Rule 2.4: Test Extensions Thoroughly
- Create comprehensive tests for new utilities
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Ensure cross-platform compatibility

### Rule 2.5: Integrate Extensions with Existing Systems
- Ensure new utilities work with the toolkit's caching system
- Integrate with the metrics collection framework
- Support the toolkit's logging and error reporting

## API Integration Registry

### Rule 3.1: Document All API Integrations
- Maintain a registry of all created API integrations
- Document the purpose and capabilities of each integration
- Include usage examples and configuration options

### Rule 3.2: Follow Integration Templates
- Use the established patterns for API integrations
- Implement consistent error handling and retry logic
- Use the toolkit's API utilities for request management

### Rule 3.3: Implement Standard Capabilities
- All API integrations should support:
  - Authentication and authorization
  - Rate limiting and throttling
  - Caching and memoization
  - Error handling and logging
  - Metrics collection

### Rule 3.4: Create Discoverable Integrations
- Use consistent naming conventions for API integrations
- Organize integrations in a discoverable structure
- Document integration points and dependencies

### Rule 3.5: Support Multiple Authentication Methods
- Implement support for various authentication methods
- Allow configuration of authentication parameters
- Securely handle credentials and tokens

## Self-Monitoring System

### Rule 4.1: Track Tool Usage
- Implement metrics collection for tool usage frequency
- Track which utilities are most commonly used
- Identify underutilized tools and potential improvements

### Rule 4.2: Measure Effectiveness
- Collect metrics on performance improvements from using the toolkit
- Track error rates and recovery success
- Measure cache hit rates and efficiency gains

### Rule 4.3: Identify Improvement Opportunities
- Analyze usage patterns to identify gaps in the toolkit
- Look for recurring custom implementations that could be abstracted
- Identify pain points and friction in using the toolkit

### Rule 4.4: Implement Feedback Loops
- Create mechanisms for capturing feedback on the toolkit
- Regularly review usage metrics and patterns
- Prioritize improvements based on impact and frequency

### Rule 4.5: Conduct Periodic Reviews
- Schedule regular reviews of toolkit usage and effectiveness
- Analyze trends in usage patterns
- Identify opportunities for documentation improvements

## Documentation Standards

### Rule 5.1: Document All Utilities
- Every utility function must have comprehensive documentation
- Include parameter descriptions and return value details
- Document exceptions and error conditions

### Rule 5.2: Provide Usage Examples
- Create examples for common use cases
- Show how to combine utilities for complex operations
- Include error handling in examples

### Rule 5.3: Maintain a Cookbook
- Create a cookbook of best practices for different scenarios
- Document patterns for common operations
- Provide templates for new implementations

### Rule 5.4: Keep Documentation Updated
- Update documentation when utilities change
- Ensure examples remain valid and functional
- Document deprecated features and migration paths

### Rule 5.5: Document Extension Points
- Clearly document how to extend the toolkit
- Provide templates and examples for extensions
- Document integration points and hooks

## Implementation Workflow

### Rule 6.1: Analysis Phase
1. Analyze the task requirements
2. Identify which AI-Tools utilities could be used
3. Check for gaps in the toolkit's capabilities
4. Plan the implementation approach

### Rule 6.2: Implementation Phase
1. Use existing toolkit utilities wherever possible
2. Follow established patterns and conventions
3. Implement new utilities for gaps in functionality
4. Ensure proper error handling and logging

### Rule 6.3: Testing Phase
1. Test the implementation with various inputs
2. Verify error handling and edge cases
3. Measure performance and efficiency
4. Ensure cross-platform compatibility

### Rule 6.4: Documentation Phase
1. Document any new utilities or extensions
2. Update existing documentation if needed
3. Create usage examples
4. Document integration points and dependencies

### Rule 6.5: Review Phase
1. Review the implementation for adherence to these rules
2. Check for opportunities to improve the toolkit
3. Identify patterns that could be abstracted
4. Document lessons learned and best practices
